# Education Vertical - Proto Domain Mapping

This document maps the Esqyma proto domain model to **education** terminology — schools, academies, tutoring centers, and certificate programs that deliver curriculum to enrolled students and track per-student learning outcomes.

The core insight: **each student is a client of the school; each course-term enrollment is a Job; the master curriculum is a JobTemplate; per-student progress lives on per-student Jobs.**

```

The `client.customer_type` field maps naturally to student tiers: `"retail"` → general enrollment (standard tuition), `"wholesale"` → group/corporate training programs, `"vip"` → scholarship / financial aid track.

Guardians (`delegate`) are the billing counterparty for minors. The `delegate_client` join table supports multiple guardians per student (divorced parents, legal guardians, sponsors).

### Product Domain → Subjects, Sections, Curriculum

The key conceptual shift: **the "product" is a subject area; a "product variant" is a specific section of that subject.**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CURRICULUM HIERARCHY                                     │

│    └── product_variant → "AP Chem - Section A - Lab"      │
│                                                           │
│  TUITION PRICING                                          │
│                                                           │
│  price_list           → "2026 Spring Tuition - Main Campus"│
│    ├── price_product  → Algebra II @ $450/term            │

│    └── price_product  → Any course @ $0 (covered)         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The `price_list.location_id` ties a tuition schedule to a campus, enabling different rates for main campus vs. satellite campuses. `date_start` / `date_end` support annual tuition renewals.

### Operations Domain → Course-Term Jobs (Per-Student Execution)

This is the critical domain for education. The operations model captures per-student academic execution: which tasks each student completed, what materials they consumed, and what grades they earned.

**The cardinality rule:** one Job per (student × course × term). Alice's Algebra II Spring 2026 is one Job. Bob's Algebra II Spring 2026 is a separate Job. They share the same `job_template_id` (the master Algebra II curriculum), but each has their own phases, tasks, and outcomes.

```

**JobActivity in education** captures per-student events that are either financial (lab kit issued, field trip fee) or academic (homework submission, tutoring session). The three typed sub-rows map cleanly:

| Sub-entity | Education Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `activity_labor` | Billable instructor time (tutoring, supplemental) | "30 min tutoring session with Ms. Garcia" |
| `activity_material` | Consumable issued to student | "Lab kit #4 issued (titration supplies)" |
| `activity_expense` | External fee charged to student's job | "PSAT exam fee $18.00" |

**Outcome tracking** closes the loop between curriculum delivery and grading:

| Entity | Education Meaning |
|---|---|
| `outcome_criteria` | Learning standard (e.g., "CCSS.MATH.7.EE.B.4 — Solve word problems") |
| `template_task_criteria` | Which standards are assessed by "Friday Quiz Week 3" |
| `task_outcome` | Alice's score on that quiz: 87/100, PROFICIENT |
| `phase_outcome_summary` | Alice's Q1 term report (GPA contribution, attendance) |
| `job_outcome_summary` | Alice's final Algebra II report card for Spring 2026 |

```

The `subscription` is the financial anchor for a student's term. When a student drops a course or takes a leave of absence, the subscription status changes — and the associated Job for each dropped course is closed or paused accordingly.

### Payment & Revenue → Tuition Billing

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TUITION BILLING FLOW                                     │

│                        Lab fee (AP Chem): $75             │
│                        Activity fee: $50                   │
│  revenue_category    → Tuition / Lab Fees / Activity Fees │
│  balance             → Alice's account balance: $0 (paid) │
│  payment             → ACH payment received $1,175        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Revenue recognition in education is typically **at enrollment** (tuition is pre-billed for the term). Lab fees and materials fees may be recognized at point-of-consumption (when the `activity_material` is logged). Activity fees (field trips) are recognized when the event occurs.

### Event Domain → Class Sessions and School Events

| Schema | Education Example |
|---|---|
| `event` | "Algebra II - Section B - Tuesday Jan 14, Period 3" (class session) |
| `event_client` | 28 enrolled students (the roster for that class period) |
| `event_product` | "Algebra II" (the subject being delivered) |
| `event_settings` | Billable: no (covered by enrollment), Location: Room 204 |
| `event_recurrence` | Every Tuesday and Thursday, Period 3, through June 2026 |

Field trips, guest lectures, and parent-teacher conferences are also modeled as `event` records. Charged field trips generate `activity_expense` entries on affected student Jobs.

### Workflow Domain → Academic Lifecycle

## Status-Driven Flow: Enrollment → Job → Report Card

In education, the academic execution lifecycle flows from enrollment (Subscription) through per-student job execution (Job) to final outcomes (JobOutcomeSummary and revenue settlement).

## Key Design Decisions

- **Student = Client, Guardian = Delegate**: The student is always the `client` — the party being served and the subject of all job/outcome records. The guardian is a `delegate` — the billing and communication contact. This separates academic tracking from financial responsibility cleanly.
- **One Job per (student × course × term)**: No polymorphic keys or junction tables. `Job.client_id` = the student; `Job.origin_id` = their enrollment subscription; `Job.job_template_id` = the master curriculum. `parent_job_id` is used only for shared/master work (e.g., a group project job linked to a master job).
- **Tuition is pre-billed; job tracks execution**: Revenue is recognized at enrollment (or by period if deferred). The Job/JobActivity system tracks *academic* execution — grades, materials consumed, extra fees — not the primary tuition revenue event. This keeps the financial and academic ledgers cleanly separated.
- **JobTemplate versioning enables curriculum updates**: When the school revises Algebra II mid-year, a new template revision is created (`DRAFT` → `PUBLISHED`). Students enrolled before the revision keep their jobs pinned to the old revision. New enrollments use the new revision. `supersedes_template_id` maintains the audit trail.
- **Teacher as inventory_item**: Instructors are modeled as `inventory_item` (type: `serialized`) at a campus location. Instructor hours logged via `inventory_transaction` support utilization reporting and (for tutoring contexts) billable time → `revenue_line_item` flows identical to professional services.

## Proto Gaps for Education (deferred — not blocking v1)

Surfaced during the verticals sense-check: education works with the existing proto stack, but four small enrichments would make it cleaner. None are required to ship — they're future polish.

### 1. Course capacity / seat limits

**Gap.** `ProductVariant` has no `max_seats` or capacity field. Today the section-capacity constraint must be tracked via a `ProductVariantOption` "capacity" attribute or external app-layer logic. There's no schema-level enforcement that "Section B Period 3" stops accepting enrollments at 30 students.

**Proposed.** A `product_section_capacity` entity OR an optional `ProductVariant.max_capacity int32` field. Capacity check fires at the use-case layer when a new Subscription targets a sold-out variant.

**Why it matters.** Over-enrollment in a section forces manual operator cleanup. Schema-level enforcement prevents the silent-failure scenario.

### 2. Prerequisite enforcement

**Gap.** Course prerequisites (must complete Algebra I before Algebra II) are not enforced at the `Plan → ProductPlan` layer. `JobTemplate.supersedes_template_id` is for curriculum versioning, not prerequisites.

**Proposed.** A `plan_prerequisite` junction table:

```proto
message PlanPrerequisite {
  string id = 1;
  string plan_id = 2 [(options.v1.db).references = "plan", (options.v1.db).index = true];
  string prerequisite_plan_id = 3 [(options.v1.db).references = "plan", (options.v1.db).index = true];
  bool required = 4;  // hard requirement vs recommendation
  optional double minimum_grade = 5;  // e.g., 70.0 = "C" or higher in prerequisite
}
```

**Why it matters.** Prerequisite-driven enrollment routing (a foundational concept in degree programs and certifications) needs structural support. Without it, registrars enforce manually.

### 3. Teacher fan-out write pattern

**Gap.** When a teacher logs one hour of instruction, the system must write **one `JobActivity + ActivityLabor` row per student-Job** — 30 writes per class period for a class of 30. This is *correct* for per-student cost attribution but creates write amplification that's painful at the use-case layer.

**Proposed.** Either:
- A dedicated `BulkLogClassActivity` use case that fans out a single operator action into N rows in one transaction
- OR a `ClassEvent` aggregate entity (NEW) that holds the shared event metadata once + a polymorphic discriminator on JobActivity to reference it

**Why it matters.** Teacher-side ergonomics and DB write throughput. Without batch handling, a daily attendance + grading workflow generates O(students × tasks × teachers × days) rows naively.

### 4. Attendance as a TaskOutcome type

**Gap.** Current `CriteriaType` enum has no `ATTENDANCE` value. Daily attendance is currently modeled as `CRITERIA_TYPE_PASS_FAIL` (present = PASS, absent = FAIL), which works but loses nuance:
- Late
- Excused absence (doctor's note)
- Unexcused absence
- Tardy returning from break

**Proposed.** Extend `CriteriaType` enum:

```proto
enum CriteriaType {
  // ... existing values ...
  CRITERIA_TYPE_ATTENDANCE_STATUS = N;  // categorical: present|tardy|excused|unexcused
}
```

OR a dedicated `AttendanceRecord` entity if the per-day, per-student volume warrants it (a school of 1000 students × 180 days × 6 periods = ~1M rows/year — fine in PG, but a dedicated entity simplifies attendance reports).

**Why it matters.** Attendance is a first-class compliance and reporting concern in K-12 (state reporting, average daily attendance funding). Burying it in PASS_FAIL constrains downstream reporting.

---

These four gaps are **independent** — each can land separately. None block the education vertical from working with the current proto. Recommend addressing in this order if/when an education customer ships:
1. Attendance enum (smallest; instant categorical reporting)
2. Course capacity (prevents over-enrollment incidents)
3. Prerequisite enforcement (structural; needs plan-graph design)
4. Teacher fan-out (performance optimization; defer until volumes warrant)
